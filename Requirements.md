The survey app will persist the survey data over time and allow an organization to organize and view said data.


### Why should we care about your product?

This will allow our users to take the data they collect from each survey and provide meaningful interpretation of that data over time.

## Scope (In/Out)

IN - What will your product do
- Our application will allow Admins to access past surveys
- Our application will allow Admins to Delete past surveys within their organization 
- Our application will allow Admins to add notes to specific past surveys within their organization
- Our application will allow Admins to create surveys with a unique title
OUT - What will your product not do.
- No Data sharing is allowed between organizations.

## Minimum Viable Product

### What will your MVP functionality be?

Our MVP will be met when
- Admin can access past surveys within their organization
- Admins to Delete past surveys within their organization
- Admins can add notes to specific past surveys within their organization
- Admins can create a survey with a unique title
	

## Stretch

### What are your stretch goals?

Rendering data into an intuitive chart as well as being able to view a results page with aggregating all data.

## Functional Requirements

List the functionality of your product. This will consist of tasks such as the following:

1. An admin can create and delete user survey data
2. An admin I can add notes to surveys
3. A user can take an Admin created survey
4. Users can view survey data rendered in a chart format
5. Admin can view survey data rendered in a chart format
6. Users can view past survey data rendered in a chart format

## Data Flow

*USER*: When the user visits the site they can fill out the form. This form is selected by the admin. The user then fills out the questions and the data is sent to the database. I would like a complete message when I am done filling out the form.

*ADMIN*: As an admin I would like to render a specified survey. I would like to review the results of surveys, both present and past. I would like to manipulate the records. I would also like to add new surveys. As an admin I would like to add a note to the past records for future reference. 

STRETCH: I would like to see all data render in one. 

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Capacity

Admins will be able to create and administer multiple surveys and store those user/survey data within their organization database. With this in mind, per the functionality and limitations of the Jotform API we can only have 5 active surveys at once.

### Security

Only allowing admins with the specific subdomain to access that organizationâ€™s data.

### Maintainability & Manageability

Refactoring and clearing out unnecessary code allows for better readability and ease of locating what needs to be edited.

### Usability

New functionality will be displayed clearly to users and organized on the page in a way that is intuitive to use.
